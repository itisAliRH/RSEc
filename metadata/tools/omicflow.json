{"tool_name":"omicflow","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"omicflow","home":"https://github.com/agusinac/OmicFlow","license":"MIT","summary":"The OmicFlow is a generalised data structure that is made to be fast and efficient in the loading and data munching of omics related data.  Omics data can be very sparse, containing many zero's and consists out of multiple files. This package only requires an up-front validated metadata template from the user, which serves as a guide to connect all the pieces together by aligning them into a single object that is defined as an omics class. The OmicFlow offers simple subsetting and transforming functions, alpha-, beta diversity and differential feature expression computations and visualisations. The autoFlow is capable to create an initial analysis based on the supplied metadata.","addition_date":"2025-08-20T09:24:38.732312Z","last_update_date":"2025-08-20T09:24:38.734552Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.3.0"]}}}
