The MEME Suite allows you to discover novel motifs in collections of unaligned nucleotide or protein sequences, and to perform a wide variety of other motif-based analyses. It provides motif discovery algorithms using both probabilistic (MEME) and discrete models (STREME), which have complementary strengths. It also allows discovery of motifs with arbitrary insertions and deletions (GLAM2). MEME-ChIP performs a comprehensive motif-based analysis of ChIP-seq and other large sequence datasets.","addition_date":"2021-12-06T13:29:02.539959Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:14:52.922980Z","tool_type":["Suite"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"STREME","home":"https://bio.tools/streme","summary":"STREME is accurate and versatile sequence motif discovery tool.
