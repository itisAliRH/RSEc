The tool is set up to be modular, but it currently supports extracting metadata from an XNAT server, converting it to the Health-RI Core v2 metadata model (https://github.com/Health-RI/health-ri-metadata/tree/v2.0.0), based on DCAT-AP v3 and Health-DCAT AP, as defined in Pydantic classes using SeMPyRO (https://github.com/Health-RI/SeMPyRO), and either writing it to an RDF file, or pushing it to a FAIR Data Point (FDP).","addition_date":"2025-08-25T14:46:01.217831Z","last_update_date":"2025-08-25T14:46:01.219964Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0.1"]}}}
