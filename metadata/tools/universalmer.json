It is available for DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The program counts and summarizes the exact frequency of all k-mers from 1-mer to a user-defined maximum length (kmax). Analyzing the k-mer spectrum across multiple values of k can be done in seconds. This program is designed for bioinformatics researchers and scientists.","addition_date":"2025-07-14T08:21:28.942611Z","last_update_date":"2025-07-14T08:21:28.944946Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["2.0.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"UniversalMer","home":"https://bio.tools/UniversalMer","license":"Freeware","version":"2.0.0","summary":"UniversalMer is a k-mer counting tool for multiple size of k at once.
